# QuboABS
QUBO solver using ABS algorithm
This code solves the NP hard problem of QUBO (Quadratic unconstrained Binary Optimization) 
It follows the Adaptive Bulk Search Algorithm described in the paper 
Ryota Yasudo, Koji Nakano, Yasuaki Ito, Masaru Tatekawa, Ryota Katsuki, Takashi Yazane, and Yoko Inaba. 2020.
